# Phoenix Participate

The frontend system for customer access to the phoenix web system

## Getting it up

### Private NPM Registry
For ```yarn install``` to work, you will need to supply the .env file with a gitlab api token into the variable ```GITLAB_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN```.  See the .env-sample file

On mac, use the command ```export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs -0)``` to export all the variables in the .env file.

### Local Development

Local development requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

_**notice**: copy the file `.env-sample` and rename it to `.env`. It provides the
environment variables required, such as the base url for API-calls. See ["Building and environment variables"](#building-and-environment-variables) below._

* To start the development server simply execute `yarn start`.

### Build and Deployment

#### Building and Environment Variables

The building process uses a set of environment variables (f.ex. the API base-url).
Webpack uses the [`dotenv-webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-webpack) plugin, and the process works as follows:

1. Variables defined in an optional `.env` file in root is loaded into the global `process.env` object.
   _`.env` files are intended for running and building locally._
2. Environment variables from the executing system/CLI session is loaded into the same global object. 
   _Names from the executing system/CLI session are prioritzed over the `.env` file._
3. References to `process.env.{NAME}` in the source code is substituted with the environment variable values at build time.
